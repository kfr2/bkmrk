ABOUT
======
Bkmrk is a quick and dirty, personal web bookmarking system, similar in style to del.icio.us.
It's (currently) meant to be used as a personal tool, but could be used to share useful links among team members, coworkers, or other trusted individuals.

By design, username/passwords or other forms of security are not currently implemented.  However, one could make use of various forms of http authentication, etc if he or she desires rudimentary protection against malicious users.

It's written in PHP and uses SQLite3 as a quick and easy datastore.

LICENSED under the MIT-Zero that can be found in LICENSE.

INSTALLATION
============
Copy the files to a web accessible location of your choice, edit the settings in bkmrk.php, then load bkmrk.php?init in a web browser.  If you have troubles creating the database, check file permissions and perhaps manually create the database file using sqlite3.  The CREATE TABLE commands are found under the ?init section of bkmrk.php.

Afterwards, the system can be accessed at bkmrk.php.  See comments in the header of bkmrk.php for a more detailed explanation of the available options.
Arguments exist for importing bookmarks from delicious xml files, etc.
